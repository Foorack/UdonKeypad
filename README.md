![VRChat Udon Keypad/Passcode](https://blog.foorack.com/content/images/2020/01/keypad2.PNG)

This is a drag-and-drop Keypad/Passcode Prefab for VRChat worlds made in Unity 2018.4.20 and **SDK3** with Udon. This prefab requires no coding from your part and is very easy to setup. Password and target door are both easily configurable, with optional support for custom activation scripts if wanting more advanced activations.

## **üì• Download:**

**Note:** In the latest release the Keypad has been rewritten into UdonSharp. Don't worry! You don't have to touch UdonSharp code I promise! Simply install UdonSharp first and forget about it. (Graph version still exists if you want to use that instead).

After installing UdonSharp and Keypad: drag the Keypad prefab into your world, click on it, and click "Compile All From Sources". If you have any problems at all, please contact me on Discord, [**Foorack#0001**](https://discordapp.com/users/92875770338213888). I would love to help with any problems!

[Download UdonSharp API](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp/releases/download/v0.19.2/UdonSharp_v0.19.2.unitypackage), install and forget.

## **‚ú® Setup Tutorial**

**Important:** After installing UdonSharp and Keypad: drag the Keypad prefab into your world, click on it, and click "Compile All From Sources".

**Settings:** Look at the settings provided on the **main Keypad object:**

![Settings available in the Keypad prefab](https://blog.foorack.com/content/images/2020/06/bild-2.png "Settings available in the Keypad prefab")

The main focus is "Door Object" (marked in green) which accepts any GameObject and will toggle active status depending on passcode status, and "Solution" (marked in yellow) which accepts any numeric passcode up to 8 numbers long.

## **üñåÔ∏è Customisation!**

The new version of Keypad supports many customization features. For example translating the Keypad into your own language, by changing the status texts. You can also make the door show the door instead of hiding the door by de-selecting the "Hide Door On Granted" checkbox. 

You can disable debugging if you know what you are doing. This will make it less verbose in console, but it is recommended to leave this on. You can also change the values of the buttons to letters, add more buttons, or change the design, they are just Unity cubes...

## **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced: Solution Scripting**

This is optional, and only recommended for people who are interested in doing Udon programming. You should at least have watched Tupper's tutorial on cube-rotation before attempting this!

There are 3 possible programs which are run at different stages: at success, at failure, and at reset. Each program calls a custom event.

| Setting name   | Event name      | Description                |
| -------------- |:---------------:| -------------------------- |
| programGranted | "keypadGranted" | Runs at successful code    |
| programDenied  | "keypadDenied"  | Runs at wrong code         |
| programClosed  | "keypadClosed"  | Runs at pressing Clear/CLR |

## **üíô Hope you enjoy it!**

You are free to use this prefab without having to credit me. But if you do use it, I would love it if you sent a quick screenshot. It really gives motivation to continuously update and improve this, as well as continue making other stuff public. Thank you!

(Optionally, if there is demand I can create a version without code and which only accepts people if their username is on a whitelist. This would prevent people from spreading the code. Tweet me or ping me on Discord if there is any interest for this.)
